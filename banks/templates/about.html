    <p>Dear User,</p>

    <p> Liquidity Manager app was created to handle front-, middle- and back-office work flow of medium sized corporate. 
        My aim is to make all processes as smooth as possible with friendly user experience. Back-end of aplication is 
        built with Phyton (Django framework) supported by PostgreSQL database. User experience handled by JavaScript,
        jQuery UI and Font Awesome.
    </p>

    <p>Best of luck!</p>
    <p>Artur</p>
